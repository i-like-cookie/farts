      <p>
        Farts, scientifically known as flatulence, are caused by the
        accumulation of gases in the digestive system. These gases are
        byproducts of the digestion process and swallowed air. The average
        person passes gas about 14 times a day, releasing between 500 to 1,500
        milliliters of gas.
